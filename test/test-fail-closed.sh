# --- LOCAL context: reviewers read files off disk, not via gh -----------------------

# checkout provably IS the PR head AND is clean, reviewers are told to read the changed
# files locally instead of running `gh` — every `gh` an agentic reviewer runs is an LLM
# round-trip. Build a repo whose HEAD the stubbed gh reports as the PR head and assert the
# reviewer's prompt tells it to read locally; a dirty or non-matching tree must fall back.
# grep uses `<<<` not `printf | grep -q`: under pipefail a matched grep -q makes printf take
# SIGPIPE and the pipeline reports 141, which reads as a failed assertion (see file header).
