**Hand a pull request off to your *other* AI coding agents for an automated cross-review.**

---

You build a feature with one agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or Antigravity), it opens a PR — and the
**others** automatically review that PR, headless, and post their findings as PR comments. (Reviewers
are *asked* to be read-only; only the OpenCode one has that enforced — see
[Notes & caveats](#-notes--caveats).) Local, free (it uses the agent CLIs you already pay for), and idempotent.

No SaaS, no per-seat review bot, no extra subscription — just the CLIs on your machine.

## 🆕 What's new

**v1.3.0** — **`pr-review-distill`: turn review feedback into written rules.** Code review comments are the
rules you forgot to write down. The new sibling reads the review feedback from recent PRs, compares it to
your `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, and asks an agent to **propose** the unwritten conventions worth adding —
read-only, propose-only, never edits your rules file. See
[Distill unwritten rules](#-distill-unwritten-rules-from-reviews-pr-review-distill).

**v1.1.0** — **fail-closed exit codes.** `✔ Relay done.` used to print and exit `0` even if every reviewer
timed out, so a caller couldn't tell *"all reviewed"* from *"everything broke"*. The relay now signals its
outcome through the exit code — `0` clean, `3` not-clean (failure / stale SHA / no reviewers), `4` cap
reached — plus macOS Bash 3.2 compatibility and a fail-closed test suite. See
[Exit codes](#-exit-codes-fail-closed).

Full history in the [**CHANGELOG**](CHANGELOG.md).

## 🤔 Why

AI agents are great at *writing* code and decent at *reviewing* it — but a second (and third)
independent pair of eyes catches more. Most "AI PR review" products are paid add-ons. If you
already use Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI and/or Antigravity CLI, you can get the same
cross-review for free: let whoever opened the PR delegate the review to the others.

## 📦 Requirements

- [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) (GitHub CLI), authenticated (`gh auth login`).
- [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) **1.7+** — `pr-review-distill` pipes the GitHub JSON through it,
  because `gh --jq` cannot emit the NUL-separated records its corpus cap needs. The `--raw-output0` flag
  it relies on landed in 1.7, and is feature-detected at startup. The other commands don't need jq.
- Any subset of these agent CLIs, logged in:
  - 🟣 [`claude`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (Claude Code) — uses `claude -p`
  - 🟢 [`codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex) (OpenAI Codex CLI) — uses `codex exec`
  - 🔵 [`cursor-agent`](https://docs.cursor.com/) (Cursor CLI) — uses `cursor-agent -p`
  - 🟠 [`agy`](https://antigravity.google/) (Antigravity CLI) — uses `agy -p` (run from shell, not inside the agy TUI)
  - ⚪ [`opencode`](https://opencode.ai) (OpenCode CLI) — uses `opencode --pure run` with a read-only agent the relay defines
    (found on `PATH` or at the stock install path `~/.opencode/bin/opencode`)
  - 🟡 [`qwen`](https://qwen.ai/qwencode) (Qwen Code CLI) — uses `qwen --safe-mode --approval-mode yolo -p`
    (`--safe-mode` ignores any hooks/extensions/skills/MCP/project config in the reviewed checkout — see
    [Notes & caveats](#-notes--caveats)). Auth is the CLI's own: sign in with the free Qwen OAuth tier, or
    point it at a paid Qwen Cloud / DashScope OpenAI-compatible endpoint via `~/.qwen/.env`
    (`QWEN_DEFAULT_AUTH_TYPE`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`). Opt-in: name it
    explicitly in `--reviewers`.

You only need the agents you actually want as reviewers.

# lib-opencode.sh is sourced, not executed — it needs no +x
# make sure ~/.local/bin is on your PATH
```

`pr-review-relay`, `pr-review-collapse-comments`, and `pr-review-consensus` expect `wrap-collapsed-pr-comment.mjs` in the same directory as those scripts (as in this repo). If you install only into `$BIN`, keep the `.mjs` file there too. `review-local` doesn't need it (it never posts anywhere).

`pr-review-relay` and `review-local` both source **`lib-opencode.sh`** from their own directory — it holds the OpenCode reviewer's binary resolution and read-only permission policy, kept in one place so the two scripts cannot drift apart on a security-relevant setting. Both refuse to start if it is missing.

### 🪟 Windows

The scripts are bash-only (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) — there is no native PowerShell support, so
**PowerShell cannot execute them directly** (no shebang support). You need
[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) for its bundled Git Bash, which is enough to
run everything below.

1. `git clone` this repo somewhere permanent, e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\Project\Work\pr-review-relay`.
   This repo ships a `.gitattributes` that forces LF line endings on the scripts, so a normal
   `git clone` is safe even if your global `core.autocrlf` is set to `true` — no CRLF-related
   `\r`-in-shebang errors under Bash. (If you instead download a ZIP, its extracted files won't go
   through Git's checkout filters, so verify the scripts have LF endings before running them.)
2. Add that repo folder to your **user PATH** so the scripts can be found by name from any directory.
   Read and update the *user*-scoped PATH explicitly — don't use `$env:Path`, since that's the merged
   effective PATH (machine + user) for the current process, and writing it back would copy
   machine-level entries into the user PATH and bloat it over time. Guard the append so re-running
   this doesn't duplicate the entry:

   ```powershell
   $repoDir = 'C:\Users\<you>\Project\Work\pr-review-relay'
   $userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'User')
   if ($userPath -notlike "*$repoDir*") {
     [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', "$userPath;$repoDir", 'User')
   }
   ```
3. Make `bash` resolve without putting all of Git's `bin` (a large pile of GNU tooling) on your
   PATH, which would change command resolution globally in every PowerShell/cmd session. Instead,
   add a small function to your PowerShell profile (`notepad $PROFILE`) that points at `bash.exe`
   directly:

   ```powershell
   function bash { & "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" @args }
   ```

   (Adjust the path if Git for Windows is installed elsewhere.) This gives you a `bash` command in
   PowerShell without exposing the rest of Git's `bin` directory on PATH.
4. **Open a new PowerShell window.** PATH changes and profile edits only apply to new processes,
   not the current session.

From then on, invoke every script from PowerShell with an explicit `bash` prefix, e.g.:

```powershell
bash pr-review-relay --author claude
bash pr-review-relay --dry-run --author claude
bash review-local --author claude
```

Run it from **inside the repo you want reviewed** (`cd` there first) — not from inside the
pr-review-relay repo itself — since the relay resolves the PR for the current working repo's branch.

`wrap-collapsed-pr-comment.mjs` and `lib-opencode.sh` still need to sit next to the scripts, same as on Linux/macOS.

## 🚀 Usage

Run it from inside the repo (it resolves the PR for the current branch):

```bash
pr-review-relay --author claude                    # claude opened the PR → codex + cursor + antigravity review
pr-review-relay --pr 47 --parallel                 # explicit PR, reviewers run concurrently
pr-review-relay --pr 47 --reviewers codex          # only one reviewer
pr-review-relay --pr 47 --reviewers claude,agy     # pick specific reviewers
pr-review-relay --context-file SPEC.md             # make every reviewer read & verify against SPEC.md
pr-review-relay --diff                             # old behaviour: pipe the diff instead of a PR link
pr-review-relay --dry-run                          # show what it would do, run no agents
```

Flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--author <name>` | The agent that opened the PR. It auto-excludes itself from reviewing. |
| `--pr <number\|url>` | Target PR. Defaults to the PR for the current branch. |
| `--reviewers a,b,c` | Which agents review. Default: `claude,codex,cursor,antigravity`. `opencode` and `qwen` are supported but opt-in — name them explicitly to include them. |
| `--context-file <path>` | Prepend a document (docs, spec, API reference) to every reviewer's prompt — they read it and verify the PR against it. Great for "check this against the official docs". |
| `--link` *(default)* | Reviewers read the changed files for context and review the embedded diff. When the relay runs from the PR's own checkout **and** that checkout is the PR head and clean, they read the files straight off local disk — no `gh` round-trips (the speed win, since each `gh` an agentic reviewer runs is an LLM call). Otherwise they fetch the files via `gh pr view`/`gh pr diff`. Either way the diff itself comes from `gh pr diff` (authoritative — matches GitHub, correct for forks). The diff is embedded as a fallback so a reviewer whose sandbox can't run `gh` still reviews something — **but only when it's under `LINK_DIFF_FALLBACK_MAX_BYTES` (default 100000)**; above that it's omitted so a huge inline diff can't blow past an agent's prompt limit. |
| `--diff` | Older behaviour: send the diff itself instead of a PR link. No longer the *raw* diff on stdin — reviewers get one document, the prompt with the diff fenced inside it, which is the same shape `--link` sends. See [how the prompt reaches each reviewer](#how-the-prompt-reaches-each-reviewer). |
| `--parallel` | Run the reviewers concurrently. |
| `--dry-run` | Resolve the PR + diff and list reviewers, without invoking agents or posting. |
| `--max-rounds N` | Hard cap on review rounds per PR (default `3`, or `$PR_RELAY_MAX_ROUNDS`). |
| `--reset` | Reset the round counter for this PR (force another round past the cap). |

Environment:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `PR_RELAY_MAX_ROUNDS` | Default max review rounds per PR. |
| `PR_RELAY_AGENT_TIMEOUT` | Per-reviewer timeout in seconds. Default: `300`. Also handed to `agy` as `--print-timeout`, because it enforces its own wait (default 5m) on top of ours — left unset, that inner limit wins whenever you raise this one, and the round dies with `timeout waiting for response` no matter how high you set it. The outer `timeout` gets a few seconds of grace so agy reaches its own limit first and gets to say so. Whether the other reviewers have internal waits of their own has not been checked. |
| `PR_RELAY_OPENCODE_MODEL` | Model for the `opencode` reviewer, e.g. `opencode/nemotron-3-ultra-free`. **Unset by default** — opencode then uses your own configured model. See the caveat below before pinning one. |
| `PR_RELAY_OPENCODE_ALLOW_IN_REPO` | Set to `1` to allow `PR_RELAY_OPENCODE_BIN` to point at a binary **inside the repository under review**. Refused by default: that file is written by whoever wrote the diff. |
| `PR_RELAY_ARGV_WARN_BYTES` | Size at which the relay warns that `qwen`/`agy` are being handed a large prompt as a command-line **argument**. Default `16000`. See below. |

### How the prompt reaches each reviewer

The relay builds **one document** — the prompt, with the diff fenced inside it in `--diff`
mode — and hands it to each reviewer the only way that reviewer accepts:

| Reviewer | Transport |
|---|---|
| `claude`, `cursor` | whole document on **stdin** (`-p` with no prompt argument) |
| `codex` | whole document on **stdin** (`codex exec -`) |
| `qwen` | `-p "$PROMPT"`, diff piped on stdin |
| `agy` | whole document as an **argv** argument — it does not read a prompt from stdin |
| `opencode` | attached file, reviewed in isolation from the repo |

This matters on **Git Bash / MSYS**, where a large prompt in argv can make the `exec` of
`timeout` itself fail with `EACCES`. That surfaces as:

```
! codex: no review — found but could not be executed (exit 126)
  │ /usr/bin/timeout: Permission denied
```

which reads as a broken agent install and is not one — the agent never started. It is
content-dependent rather than a simple length cap (a same-length filler string passes,
and a 200 KB argv passes to an MSYS child), and the underlying MSYS cause is unidentified.
Moving the document to stdin sidesteps it entirely, which is why every reviewer that can
read stdin now does.

`qwen` and `agy` still put a prompt in argv and remain exposed. The relay warns above
`PR_RELAY_ARGV_WARN_BYTES` rather than refusing, since the limit does not apply on every
platform. Note the remedies differ: `--diff` helps `qwen` (the diff moves into its pipe)
and **hurts** `agy` (the diff moves into its argument).
| `PR_RELAY_OPENCODE_BIN` | Path to the `opencode` binary. Any resolution that goes through `PATH` — implicit, or a **bare name** given here — refuses a binary found *inside the repository under review* (a `.` on your `PATH`, or a repo-local bin dir), since that file was written by the same person as the diff. A value **containing a `/`** that resolves inside the repo is refused too, unless `PR_RELAY_OPENCODE_ALLOW_IN_REPO=1`. The guard only applies inside a git worktree. Absolute paths, relative paths and bare `PATH` names all work — the value is resolved to an absolute path before use, because the reviewer runs from a different working directory. A leading `~` or `~/` **is** expanded (it reaches the variable as a literal character, so the shell never does it for you) — but only when `HOME` is set; the `~user/…` form is *not* supported, give a real path for that; otherwise the relay refuses rather than turning `~/bin/opencode` into `/bin/opencode`. Only needed for a non-standard install: the relay already finds it on `PATH` or at `~/.opencode/bin/opencode`. |

## 🧪 Review before there's a PR (`review-local`)

Same cross-review, but for a branch you haven't opened a PR for yet — no `gh`, no PR number, no
posted comments. It diffs your **current checked-out branch** against a base ref, sends that diff
to the other agents and prints each review straight to the screen. Use it to get a clean,
already-reviewed branch before you push and open the PR.

```bash
review-local --author claude                        # claude wrote this branch → codex + cursor + antigravity review
review-local --author claude --base develop          # diff against a different base ref (default: main)
review-local --author claude --reviewers codex,agy   # pick specific reviewers
review-local --author claude --parallel              # run reviewers concurrently
```

Flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--author <name>` | The agent that wrote the branch. It auto-excludes itself from reviewing. |
| `--base <ref>` | Ref to diff against. Default: `main`. |
| `--reviewers a,b,c` | Which agents review. Default: `claude,codex,cursor,antigravity`. `opencode` and `qwen` are supported but opt-in — name them explicitly to include them. |
| `--parallel` | Run the reviewers concurrently. |

Reviewers that read stdin (`claude` / `codex` / `cursor` / `qwen`) get the diff piped in, so a large branch
scales the same way `pr-review-relay --diff` does; `agy` takes it as an argument (it doesn't read a
prompt from stdin); `opencode` receives it as an attached file and reviews it in isolation from the
repo (see the OpenCode note under [Notes & caveats](#-notes--caveats)). Nothing is pushed or posted
anywhere — `review-local` only ever prints to your terminal.

## 🔁 Make it automatic (the handoff)

Tell each agent to call the relay right after it opens a PR. Add a line to each agent's
instructions file (these are global, so they apply in every repo):

**🟣 Claude Code** — `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:
> When you open a Pull Request, run `pr-review-relay --author claude`.

**🟢 Codex** — `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`:
> After you open a Pull Request, run `pr-review-relay --author codex`.

**🔵 Cursor** — `~/.cursor/AGENTS.md`:
> After you open a Pull Request, run `pr-review-relay --author cursor`.

**🟠 Antigravity** — `~/.antigravity/AGENTS.md` (or equivalent):
> After you open a Pull Request, run `pr-review-relay --author antigravity` (or `--author agy`).
> Use `agy -p` from a normal shell — not from inside the interactive agy chat.

> **Note:** the relay invokes Antigravity as `agy --dangerously-skip-permissions --print-timeout <PR_RELAY_AGENT_TIMEOUT>s -p`. That is headless, but it is **not** sandboxed — see the caveat under [Notes & caveats](#-notes--caveats).

**⚪ OpenCode** — `~/.opencode/AGENTS.md`:
> After you open a Pull Request, run `pr-review-relay --author opencode`.

**🟡 Qwen Code** — `~/.qwen/QWEN.md`:
> After you open a Pull Request, run `pr-review-relay --author qwen`.

> **Note:** as a *reviewer*, qwen runs `--safe-mode`, so it ignores this `QWEN.md` (and any other
> checkout config) — the snippet only wires the *authoring* role. See the caveat under
> [Notes & caveats](#-notes--caveats).

Now whoever opens the PR, the others review it — no manual step.

## 🔄 Closing the loop: read the reviews and iterate

The relay runs the reviewers **synchronously** and **prints every review to stdout** (in addition to
posting them as PR comments). So the agent that launched the relay gets the full feedback back **in
its own command output** — it can analyze the findings, fix them, push, and re-run. Because the relay
is idempotent, re-running just refreshes the comments (one per agent).

A typical agent instruction to make this a loop:

> After opening a PR, run `pr-review-relay --author <self>`. **Branch on its exit code — only `0` is a
> clean round** (every reviewer actually ran and posted, PR head unchanged). On `3` the round is not
> trustworthy (a reviewer failed / the SHA couldn't be confirmed / HEAD moved) — **don't act on the
> posted reviews, re-run against the current head**. On `4` the round cap is hit — stop and escalate.
> On a clean `0`, read the reviews it prints, address every **Blocker** and **Should-fix**, commit and
> push, then run it again. Repeat until no blockers remain (max ~3 rounds), then summarize what you changed.
>
> When reviewers agree on what still matters, save a **consensus work card** (only agreed Blockers /
> Should-fix / Nits) and run `pr-review-consensus --consensus-file path.md` so the PR description
> shows the consensus and cross-review comments stay collapsed.

Need to re-read the latest reviews later (e.g. a slower reviewer landed after you moved on)? Use the
companion command:

```bash
pr-review-fetch         # prints the cross-review comments for the current branch's PR
pr-review-fetch 47      # …for a specific PR
```

## 📋 Consensus + collapsed reviews (clean PR page)

Cross-review comments are posted **collapsed** by default (`<details>/<summary>` — click to expand, like forum hide/show). The **PR description** stays the place readers focus on after you synthesize consensus.

**Workflow:**

1. Open PR → `pr-review-relay --author <self>` (iterate fix/push/re-run until blockers are gone).
2. Read all review comments (`pr-review-fetch`) and write a **consensus work card** (only items multiple reviewers agreed on — Blockers / Should-fix / Nits).
3. Apply consensus to the PR description and collapse any still-expanded review comments:

```bash
pr-review-consensus --consensus-file reviews/pr-47-consensus.md
# or: pr-review-consensus --pr 47 --consensus-file path.md
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pr-review-consensus` | Replace PR body with consensus markdown; collapse cross-review comments |
| `pr-review-collapse-comments` | Collapse existing relay comments only (no body change) |
| `--append-original` | Keep original PR description in a collapsed block at the bottom |
| `--no-collapse` | Update body only, leave comment expand state unchanged |

Retrofit old PRs (comments only):

```bash
pr-review-collapse-comments 47
```

Consensus file format: same idea as dac-audit-skill issue bodies — summary table, **Blockers (consensus)**, **Should-fix (consensus)**, optional Consider. The file becomes the PR description (plus a PR link header).

## 🧭 Distill unwritten rules from reviews (`pr-review-distill`)

> Inspired by [Marco Gomiero — *Code review comments are the rules you forgot to write down*](https://www.marcogomiero.com/posts/2026/code-review-agents-update/).

The relay makes reviewers repeat themselves — the same "add a test", "use snake_case", "don't do X"
lands on PR after PR. Each repeat is a project convention that isn't yet written in your instructions file.
`pr-review-distill` closes that loop: it mines the review feedback from recent PRs, subtracts what your
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` already says, and asks an agent to **propose** the rules worth adding.

It is **read-only and propose-only** — it never edits your rules file. You get a ready-to-paste markdown
proposal (each rule cites the PRs it came from); you decide what to keep.

```bash
pr-review-distill                          # last 20 merged PRs of the current repo, propose via claude
pr-review-distill --limit 40 --agent codex # more history, a different agent
pr-review-distill --dry-run                # show which PRs + rules file, don't call an agent
pr-review-distill --print-comments         # just dump the gathered feedback corpus
pr-review-distill --out proposed-rules.md  # also write the proposal to a file
```

It reads three feedback sources per PR — top-level review bodies, inline review comments, and issue-style
comments (which include the relay's own automated cross-reviews). The rules baseline is auto-detected
from the git root (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a `.cursor/rules` directory); point it at a specific one
with `--rules-file`.

Point it at another repo with `--repo OWNER/NAME` — but pass `--rules-file` too, since the rules
baseline is otherwise auto-detected from the current directory (the wrong repo). `--state` takes
`merged` (default), `closed`, `open`, or `all`.

Run it **monthly** (a cron job or a Claude skill) so the instructions file self-heals from the review
loop instead of drifting.

**Untrusted input — read-only, but not a sandbox.** The corpus is PR comments, and a comment can try to
prompt-inject the agent. The corpus is passed inside a **fence** whose marker is generated per run and
checked against the corpus before use, and the task states that anything within it is data — so a
comment cannot forge a section boundary using the prompt's own `---` / `## …` markers (ending the
feedback early, faking the existing-rules block, or emitting the empty-result sentinel). That closes the
structural forgery only; prose that argues with the model is still prose it may believe. `--agent` only offers agents pinned to a read-only mode on the command line
(never relying on ambient settings a checkout could carry): `claude` (default, `--permission-mode plan` —
plan mode can't edit or run commands), `codex` (`-s read-only`), `cursor` (`--mode=ask`). Each runs from
an empty scratch directory so no checkout-local config or hooks load, and the prompt is fed via **stdin**
(so a large review history can't blow the ~128 KiB argv limit). `antigravity` is not offered — its
headless CLI would need `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.

This blocks **writes and command execution**, but it is **not full isolation**: a read-only agent can
still read files it can reach and use whatever MCP tools / network your ambient config grants, so a
crafted comment could in principle steer those. Same threat model as the rest of this toolkit (see
[Notes & caveats](#-notes--caveats)) — run it on repos whose review history you don't consider actively
hostile. The corpus is capped (`PR_DISTILL_MAX_CORPUS_BYTES`, default 300 KB) so a flooded history can't
exhaust memory or blow the agent's context. The cap applies **while reading**, not after: records
arrive NUL-separated and are cut at a record boundary, so a single PR carrying more than the cap
is bounded and no comment is delivered half-written. Truncation says which kind it was — whole PRs
skipped, or one PR's feedback cut short. A cap too small for even one comment is a config error,
not an empty result. A non-zero agent exit fails the run (a truncated proposal is never emitted as
complete), and a failed GitHub fetch — or a `jq` failure — is surfaced as an `INCOMPLETE CORPUS`
warning. Raise the per-agent budget with `PR_DISTILL_AGENT_TIMEOUT` (default 300s).

## 🛡️ Loop safety (no runaway iteration)

Telling an agent to "fix and re-run" can spiral. Two layers keep it bounded:

- **Soft:** the agent is told to stop once there are no Blockers/Should-fix left.
- **Hard:** the relay enforces a **per-PR round cap** (default 3). Once hit, it refuses to run
  reviewers, prints a clear ⛔ STOP message, and **exits `4`** so the agent ends the loop instead of
  mistaking it for a pass. The counter lives in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pr-review-relay/`, **auto-resets after
  6h** of inactivity (a fresh session), and can be cleared with `--reset`. Tune with `--max-rounds N` or
  `PR_RELAY_MAX_ROUNDS`.

## 🔍 How it works

1. Resolves the PR (current branch or `--pr`) and reads the diff with `gh pr diff` (used as a sanity
   guard and for the line/byte summary).
2. For each reviewer (except `--author`), runs the agent **headless** with a focused
   review prompt. By default (**`--link`**) the reviewer reads the changed files in context — so it
   reviews the *whole* PR, not just a diff snapshot. When the relay is run from the PR's own checkout and
   that checkout is the PR head and clean, it reads those files **straight off local disk** (no `gh`
   round-trips — the speed win); otherwise it fetches them via `gh pr view`/`gh pr diff`. The diff itself
   always comes from `gh pr diff` (authoritative, fork-safe) and is embedded as a **fallback** so a
   reviewer whose sandbox can't run `gh` still returns a review — but the fallback is **omitted for large
   diffs** (over `LINK_DIFF_FALLBACK_MAX_BYTES`, default 100000) so an oversized inline diff can't exceed
   an agent's prompt limit. With **`--diff`** only the raw diff is sent. A **`--context-file`** is
   prepended so every reviewer verifies against it.
3. Posts each review as a **collapsed** PR comment via `gh pr comment` (forum-style `<details>`),
   tagged per agent (🟣 Claude / 🟢 Codex /
   🔵 Cursor / 🟠 Antigravity / ⚪ OpenCode).
4. **Idempotent:** before posting, it deletes any previous review from the *same* agent on that PR,
   so re-runs replace rather than duplicate — one current review per agent.

## 🚦 Exit codes (fail-closed)

`✔ Relay done.` alone doesn't mean "everyone reviewed" — so the relay signals the outcome through its
**exit code**, and fails closed (any doubt → non-zero). A script driving the handoff should branch on it:

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|------|---------|------------|
| `0` | Every reviewer that ran produced **and posted** a review, and the PR head didn't move. | Everyone *ran* — not that it's approved. Read the reviews, resolve every Blocker/Should-fix, then merge. |
| `3` | Not a clean round: a reviewer returned empty / timed out / exited non-zero / failed to post, **or** an explicitly-requested reviewer was missing, **or** no reviewer ran, **or** HEAD moved mid-round (reviews now describe stale code). | Fix the cause and re-run; don't treat as reviewed. |
| `4` | Review-round cap reached. | Stop looping; escalate to a human. |
| `1`/`2` | Usage/precondition error (no `gh`, no PR, empty diff, bad arg). | Fix the invocation. |

A missing CLI from the **default** reviewer set is a tolerated skip (users have different agents
installed); only reviewers named explicitly via `--reviewers` are required to be present. Each posted
review's footer records the **reviewed SHA** so you can tell whether a review predates a later push.

> **Note:** reviews are posted as they complete, *before* the end-of-round SHA re-check. So a round that
> ends in `3` (a reviewer failed, or HEAD moved mid-round) may still have left comments on the PR — tagged
> with the SHA they reviewed. Trust the **exit code**, not the mere presence of comments: on `3`, re-run
> and read the fresh round. A round that actually dispatched reviewers **consumes one cap slot even when it
> ends in `3`** (a persistently flaky reviewer must still hit the cap) — a round where *nobody* ran does not.

### A note on `PATH`

Both scripts **refuse to start** (exit `2`) if any `PATH` entry resolves inside the repository being
reviewed — a `.` entry, a repo-local `bin/`, or a symlink to either. Everything the relay runs (`gh`,
`git`, `timeout`, `node`, …) comes from `PATH`, so a repo-controlled entry means the branch under
review chooses those binaries. If you see that error, take the entry out of `PATH`.

One limit worth knowing: the check cannot cover the *interpreter*. `#!/usr/bin/env bash` has already
picked a `bash` through `PATH` before the first line runs. Nothing a script does can fix that — if
`PATH` points into an untrusted checkout, every command you type is affected, not just this one.

### `review-local` exit codes

`review-local` follows the same fail-closed idea as the relay, on a smaller surface:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | every dispatched reviewer produced a review |
| `3` | a reviewer produced nothing usable (empty / whitespace-only / timed out / non-zero), **or** an explicitly requested reviewer was missing, **or** no reviewer ran at all |
| `1`/`2` | precondition or usage error (not a repo, unknown base ref, bad argument, unusable `PR_RELAY_OPENCODE_BIN`) |

## 📋 Notes & caveats

- **⚠️ Only the OpenCode reviewer is enforced read-only.** The others are asked not to modify
  anything and normally don't — but a prompt is not a boundary, and the thing they are reading is
  exactly what would try to argue them out of one. They all predate the OpenCode work and are
  documented rather than quietly changed: tightening any of them affects that agent's reviews and
  belongs in its own PR, where the effect can be tested.
  - **Codex** — `pr-review-relay` invokes it as `codex exec -s danger-full-access`, so it can write
    files and run commands while reading a diff an untrusted contributor wrote. (`review-local` uses
    `-s read-only`, so the two disagree with each other.)
  - **Antigravity** — `agy --dangerously-skip-permissions -p` auto-approves permissions. The prompt
    asks it not to modify anything, but a prompt is not a boundary, and the content it is reading is
    exactly what would try to talk it out of one.
  - **Claude** — `claude -p` honours permission rules from `settings.json`, and the relay runs inside
    the checkout, so a PR-controlled `.claude/settings.json` can pre-authorise Bash or Write. No
    enforced deny-list is supplied on the command line.
  - **Cursor** — `cursor-agent -p --trust --mode=ask` keeps it in Q&A mode, which is the closest to a
    real constraint of the three, but it is still the agent's own mode rather than an enforced policy.
  - **Qwen** — `qwen --safe-mode --approval-mode yolo -p`. `yolo` auto-approves shell/write with no
    sandbox, the same unconfined posture as Codex and Antigravity above. What it adds over them is
    `--safe-mode`: Qwen Code otherwise loads `.qwen/settings.json` / `QWEN.md` / hooks / extensions /
    skills / MCP servers from the checkout it runs in — the same PR-controlled injection surface the
    Claude bullet warns about — and `--safe-mode` turns all of that off, so a reviewed branch can't ship
    config that executes during review. `yolo` (rather than `--approval-mode plan`) is kept so the
    reviewer can still run `gh` to fetch the PR in link mode; for stricter isolation, run it under a
    sandbox (`--sandbox` / `QWEN_SANDBOX`) if your machine has one configured. The relay sets
    `QWEN_CODE_SUPPRESS_YOLO_WARNING=1` on the invocation purely to keep the yolo-no-sandbox banner off
    the captured review output — it changes nothing about what the reviewer may do.
- **OpenCode is the exception, and it is enforced:** `opencode --pure run` with a primary agent the
  relay defines itself and an inline default-deny policy. `--pure` matters — it stops external plugins,
  which execute at startup regardless of permissions.
- **OpenCode read-only is enforced by config, not by the agent name.** Selecting a built-in agent is *not* a
  sandbox — their permissions are user-configurable, and `agent.plan.mode: "subagent"` in a config makes
  OpenCode fall back to `build` with *that* agent's rules (verified: shell came back). The relay
  therefore defines and selects its own primary agent, whose mode and permissions are both fixed. Each invocation sets
  `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` (a runtime override that outranks your own `opencode.json`) to a
  **deny-everything** policy — `"*": "deny"`, no allowlist (see the next bullet) — repeated on the
  relay's own agent, because OpenCode applies agent-scoped permissions
  *after* the global ones, so the agent actually in use has to carry the policy too. It also runs with `--pure` so external plugins, which execute at startup, don't load.
  Deliberately **not** run with `--auto`, which would auto-approve every `ask` permission.
- **The OpenCode reviewer gets no tools at all.** Not "no writes" — nothing: `"*": "deny"`, with no
  allowlist. It does not need any, because the diff reaches it as prompt content via `-f` rather than
  through a tool call; a review of the attachment is identical with every tool denied. Allowing reads
  was the last exfiltration route, since they were not confined to the attachment and the relay
  **posts** the result: a prompt-injected diff could have had the model read a credential and quote it
  into a public PR comment.
- **Shell is denied, so OpenCode never fetches the PR itself** — the diff is attached to the prompt as
  a file instead, in both modes and at any size. Narrower designs were tried first and each was demonstrably
  bypassable: the original `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (an undocumented alias for `--auto`, so it
  approved everything); selecting the built-in `plan` agent (its permissions and even its mode are
  user-configurable — it ran `id`, and redirecting it to a subagent fell back to `build`); allowing just `gh pr view` / `gh pr diff` (defeated by shell
  redirection — `gh pr view N > file` matches the allowed prefix and writes); omitting the
  policy on the agent actually selected (agent-scoped permissions apply after the global ones); and denying tools by
  name (anything unnamed — custom tools, MCP servers — stays allowed by default). The full list, with
  what each failed on, is in `lib-opencode.sh`.
- **OpenCode runs outside the repository, and therefore reviews the diff alone.** It does not browse
  the checkout the way the other reviewers do. This is not a limitation we could avoid: OpenCode reads
  the project `opencode.json` from its working directory, and an `mcp` server declared there is
  **launched at startup, before any tool permission applies** — so a pull request that adds an
  `opencode.json` would get arbitrary command execution simply by being reviewed. Verified: a planted
  MCP entry ran its command with `"*": "deny"` and `--pure` both in force. Neither the permission
  policy nor `--pure` (plugins only) prevents it; not reading attacker-authored config does.
- **Cursor needs `--trust`** in headless mode or it blocks on a workspace-trust prompt — handled.
- **Cursor is slower/chattier** than Codex; its comment may land a bit later.
- **Link mode is the default:** each reviewer fetches the PR itself and reads the changed files in
  context — deeper than a diff snapshot. The diff is embedded as a fallback, so a sandbox that can't run
  `gh` (notably `codex exec --read-only`) still reviews the diff instead of returning nothing. Pass
  `--diff` for the older diff-only behaviour. Either way the agent runs in the repo — except OpenCode, which is deliberately launched outside it (see the caveats above).
- **Verify against sources** with `--context-file <path>`: the document is prepended to every
  reviewer's prompt, so they cross-check the PR against e.g. an official spec or API reference instead
  of relying on memory. The reviewer comment is footnoted with the context file's name.
- **Antigravity** needs `agy` on PATH; invoke `agy -p` from zsh/bash (not inside the agy TUI). In some sandboxes it may hang — run relay from your Mac terminal if needed.
- Runs on your machine, so it works when your machine is on. It's a local relay, not a hosted bot.
